We are making a high prequency trader. 

I'm going to try to make the thing look pretty. 

Oscar is figuring out how to get data using the API

There are a few options for how to make this work. You could just say "if the market is lower than average buy and higher than average sell"

calculate a 20 day moving average which is a pretty simple formula or a longer moving average for more long term investing strategies. 

You could also do a random walk approach which is what a lot of people recomend. or buy an etf like QQQ or vti whick follows the trend of a larger fund but is more accessible for people with less money to buy


The web app also needs to look pretty.
